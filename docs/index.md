# Welcome to BioKT-PLUMED-docs
This website is a resource aimed at researchers from the BioKT lab
to have working examples of different types of molecular dynamics 
simulations that can be run using [Gromacs](https://www.gromacs.org/)
 patched with [PLUMED](https://www.plumed.org/). These examples 
borrow extensively from the fantastic 
[PLUMED masterclasses](https://www.plumed.org/masterclass), but are
necessarily less exhaustive and intended to provide working examples
of methods we routinely employ.
