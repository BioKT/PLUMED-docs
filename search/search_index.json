There are multiple options available for you. Installing with conda If you only want a hassle-free installation to try things out, then you can simply use the pre-compiled versions made available by the PLUMED developers for their masterclasses. Here I follow the instructions from the first masterclass In the terminal, type $ conda create --name plumed-masterclass and then $ conda activate plumed-masterclass $ conda install -c conda-forge plumed py-plumed numpy pandas matplotlib notebook mdtraj mdanalysis git $ conda install --strict-channel-priority -c plumed/label/masterclass -c conda-forge gromacs Patch Gromacs with PLUMED First install PLUMED. In order to do this you will have to download and unzip the software $ wget https://github.com/plumed/plumed2/archive/refs/heads/master.zip $ unzip master.zip $ cd plumed2-master/ Then you will follow the usual steps to install software using Make $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local $ make $ sudo make install You will also have to make sure that the installed libraries are visible in your path export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib The next step is to install Gromacs. First download the code and unzip the package. In this case I am patching the 2021.6 version of Gromacs. wget ftp://ftp.gromacs.org/gromacs/gromacs-2021.6.tar.gz tar -xvf gromacs-2021.6.tar.gz The next thing I did was to check whether I could use Cmake to install with my desired options, in this case running with GPUs and compiling with MPI support cd gromacs-2021.6/ mkdir build cd build/ cmake .. -DGMX_BUILD_OWN_FFTW=ON -DREGRESSIONTEST_DOWNLOAD=ON -DGMX_MPI=on -DGMX_GPU=CUDA -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/gromacs/2021.6 make Then comes the key step of running the plumed patch command cd .. plumed patch -p After that you can go back to your Gromacs install directory and finish the installation as usual cd build/ cmake .. -DGMX_BUILD_OWN_FFTW=ON -DREGRESSIONTEST_DOWNLOAD=ON -DGMX_MPI=on -DGMX_GPU=CUDA -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/gromacs/2021.6 make sudo make install /opt/gromacs/2021.6/bin/gmx_mpi mdrun -h","title":"Setup"},{"location":"setup/#setting-up-plumed-with-gromacs","text":"First of all you must patch the Gromacs code with PLUMED.
